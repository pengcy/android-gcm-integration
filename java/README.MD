**MainActivity.java** is the default Main Activity Java file generated by Android Studio, the only line added to it is: 
````java
//Register GCM
new GcmRegistrationAsyncTask(this).execute();
````

The other 3 java files should be put in a folder push_notification under your root package, or you can put them anywhere in your package.
<br>

In **GcmIntentService.java**, look for strings containing "your.package", replace it with your package name.<br>

In **GcmRegistrationAsyncTask.java**, look for the variable SENDER_ID, replace the question marks with the project number which can be found from your google developer console. And look for the url https://yourapp-5d8df.appspot.com/ and replace it with your google clouding messaging console url.


After these java classes are added, you will have to fix some import issues.
